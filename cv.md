**Contact Info** Floor Cage 6900sq, Bergen, Norway

**Summary**

I am a very small Syrian hamster. I like to sleep hide and eat. I hate people and dogs. I like to burrow and my goal is to dig up all my cage.
I am dreaming about run away from my cage, I wish I could find a way to do it, because the family I live with is annoying me, they play guitar, bark, scream, listen to music and try to find and catch me all the time.
